## [Multiple Linear Regression - Factors Affecting Crime](https://handecelebi.github.io/mlr/regression.html)

In this project, I examined the factors affecting crime according to 81 cities in Turkey with multiple regression analysis. 
For this study, I used 1 dependent 5 independent variables and explained 3 independent variables in the final version of the model. 
The study consists of linearity control, regression analysis, assumptions control, normality control, and the creation of the final model, respectively. 
As a result while City Population and Literacy Rate have an increasing effect on the Number of convicts, Immigration from abroad to Turkey has a decreasing effect.

## [Fake News Classification](https://handecelebi.github.io/fake-news/fake_real.html)

In this project, I created classification algorithms that detect whether the news received from news websites are real or fake. 
Before starting the analysis, I made an exploratory data analysis and examined the factors according to which the news in the data set was distributed. 
Then I applied the necessary cleaning and transformation processes in the text data. The study includes 3 different classification algorithms. 
These are naive bayes, logistic regression, and random forest. As a result of 3 models applied, random forest provided the highest accuracy value.

## [Association Rules - Market Basket Analysis](https://handecelebi.github.io/market-basket/market-basket.html)

In this study, I made a market basket analysis of the sales data of a supermarket. 
The aim is to discover the purchasing trends of the customers and to investigate which products are bought with which other products. 
It is also to predict possible patterns by creating a logical set of rules.
For this analysis, first I used Apriori and then Eclat algorithms and explained the differences between their process and the parameters it contains. 
Both algorithms have produced similar results.
