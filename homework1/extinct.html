                The Smilodon (saber-toothed cat) lived in North and South America at the end of the last glacial period, though it evolved as a separate species around 2.5 million years ago. The largest subspecies, Smilodon populator, could reach 400 kg in weight, three meters in length, and 1.4 meters tall at the shoulder. Despite being called a saber-toothed tiger, it was actually built more like a bear, with short, powerful limbs that were not designed for speed. Its notable canines could reach 30 cm (one foot) in length but were fragile and mainly used for biting into soft neck tissue after its prey had been subdued. It could open its jaws 120 degrees but had a relatively weak bite.</p>

                    <br>
                    From Ireland to Siberia, Irish Elk (Megaloceros giganteus) populated much of northern Europe at the end of the last glacial period. Since they have little in common with extant elk species, they are more precisely known as "giant deer." They could grow up to seven feet tall at the shoulder and weigh up to 700kg. Their antlers were the largest of any deer species, reaching 12 feet in width. It is likely that the sizable antlers evolved through sexual selection, as males used them to intimidate rivals and impress females.

                    <br>
                    The Woolly Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) inhabited much of the arctic tundra regions of the northern hemisphere in the early Holocene period. These massive creatures could reach 11 feet in height and weigh six tonnes, which is about the same size as African elephants, though their closest relative is the Asian elephant. However, unlike the elephant, it was covered in brown, black, and ginger fur. It also had a shortened tail to minimize frostbite.

                    The Moa (Dinornithiformes) was a huge species of flightless bird native to New Zealand. They could grow to almost four meters in height (12 feet) and weigh 230 kg. Despite their incredible height, the bird's vertebrae suggest they spent much of their time with their necks pointed forward. These long necks likely produced low-pitched, resonant calling sounds.

It was discovered by Georg Wilhelm Steller, and within three decades was hunted to extinction by Europeans, who followed Steller's route.

                    The Great Auk (Pinguinus impennis) was a flightless bird that resembled a present-day penguin. Like the penguin, it was a powerful swimmer, stored fat for warmth, nested in dense colonies, and mated for life; however, it also had a heavy hooked beak. It could grow to almost three feet in height and lived in the north Atlantic ocean.

                    The Atlas bear (Ursus arctos crowtheri) is an extinct bear subspecies found in Northern Africa. Zoologists classified it as a separate species after it was brought to the public's attention by an English serviceman named Crowther in 1840. This species was stockier and sturdier than the American black bear. It was Africa's only native bear that survived into modern times.

Quagga lived in South Africa and got their name from the sound they make (onomatopoeic).

It was the smallest species of wolf in the Canis lupus family, growing to about three feet in length, and 12 inches at the shoulder. In the Shinto belief (the traditional religion of Japan), the ōkami ("wolf") is regarded as a messenger of the kami spirits and also offers protection against crop raiders such as the wild boar and deer. There are an estimated 20 Shinto wolf shrines on Honshu alone.

                    <br>
                    The Tasmanian Tiger (Thylacine) was the largest carnivorous marsupial of the modern era, evolving around 4 million years ago. It became extinct in the 1930s due to excessive hunting by farmers who blamed it for killing sheep and poultry. Other factors were a loss of habitat to agriculture, disease, and the introduction of dogs. This remarkable creature lived in Tasmania, Australia, and New Guinea and could grow to almost two meters in length from head to tail. The Tasmanian Tiger was at the top of the food chain (apex predator) and nocturnally ambushed prey including kangaroos, wallabies, possums, birds, and small mammals. Its jaws could open 120 degrees, and its stomach could distend to consume large quantities of food, meaning it could survive in sparsely populated areas. It was an unusual marsupial because both sexes had a pouch; the male used it to protect its genitals when running through the brush.
